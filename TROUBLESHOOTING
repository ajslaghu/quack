There seems to be a problem with Perl 5.18+ and deepzoom 0.05.
http://search.cpan.org/~drrho/Graphics-DZI-0.05/script/deepzoom

It complains about an enum being wrongly initialized. 
https://metacpan.org/pod/release/ETHER/Moose-2.1106-TRIAL/lib/Moose/Manual/Delta.pod#pod2.1200

The problem can be solved by replacing
  enum 'packing' => qw( exponential linear );
with 
  enum 'packing' => [qw( exponential linear )];
in the file 
  /usr/local/share/perl/5.18.2/Graphics/DZI/A4.pm
(or similar folder).
