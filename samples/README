*** Copyright and source

The originating newspaper issue for the sample images is from 1795 and thus
out of danish copyright. The rights to the digital images as well as the
corresponding ALTO files has been released by Statsbiblioteket (State and 
University Library, Denmark).

The sample files are downscaled and strongly compressed to avoid bloating
the git repository. They should not be seen as representative of production 
scans. The original scans are 300 DPI equivalent, in lossless JPEG 2000.


*** How to use the sample

From the main quack folder, issue the following command
  ./quack.sh samples samples_qa
then open the file samples_qa/index.html in a browser.
